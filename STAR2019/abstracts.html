Multiplicative coagulation process and random graphs in sparse regime: a large-deviations approach
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<b> Abstract: </b>
</td><td>
 At least since the days of Smoluchowski, there is a desire to understand the behaviour of large particle systems that undergo chemical reactions of coagulation type. One of the phenomena that attracts much attention is the question for the existence of a phase transition of gelation type, i.e., the appearance of a particle of macroscopic size in the system. In this talk, we consider the (non-spatial) coagulating model (sometimes called the Marcus-Lushnikov model), starting with N particles with mass one each, where each two particles coagulate after independent exponentially distributed times that depend on a given coagulation kernel, proportional to the product of the two masses. This case is of particular interest also for its strong relations with the connected components of a time dependent Erdős-Rényi random graph in the sparse regime. We work for fixed time t > 0 and derive, for the number N of initial particles going to infinity, a joint large-deviations principle for all relevant quantities in the system (microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic particle sizes) with an explicit rate function. We deduce laws of large numbers and in particular derive from that the well-known phase transition at time t = 1, the time at which a macroscopic particle (correspondent to the giant component of the random graph) appears, as well as the Smoluchowski characterisation of the statistics of the finite-sized particles. This is a joint work with Wolfgang König (WIAS and TU Berlin) and Robert Patterson (WIAS).

Powers of Hamiltonian cycles in randomly augmented graphs
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<b> Abstract: </b> 
</td><td>
The method of absorption has been introduced over a decade ago by R&ouml;dl, Ruci&nacute;ski and Szemer&eacute;di. It is an extremely versatile technique which enables one to solve a variety of combinatorial problems concerning the existence of spanning substructures in graphs and hypergraphs satisfying certain minimum degree conditions. 
<br><br>
As an example, we investigate the existence of powers of Hamiltonian cycles in graphs with large minimum degree 
to which some additional edges have been added in a random manner. It follows from the
theorems of Dirac and of Koml&oacute;s, Sark&ouml;zy, and Szemer&eacute;di, who
confirmed the Pos&aacute;--Seymour conjecture, that for every $k \geq 1$
and sufficiently large $n$ already the minimum degree $\delta(G) \geq \frac{k}{k+1}n$
for an $n$-vertex graph $G$ alone suffices to ensure the existence of
the $k$-th power of a Hamiltonian cycle. 
Here we show that under essentially the same degree assumption the addition of just $O(n^{-2/\ell})$
random edges ensures the presence of the $(k\ell + r)$-th power of a
Hamiltonian cycle, where $r\geq 1$ and $\ell \geq r(r+1)$, with probability approaching one as $n \rightarrow \infty$.

Geometric Statistics of Point Processes:
Limit Theory and (Some) Statistical Learning
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<b> Abstract: </b>
</td><td>
We establish  the limit theory for  stabilizing functionals
of  stationary point processes on $R^d$ having fast decay of
correlations. Typical examples are  local statistics of geometric graphs,
previously studied on Poisson process and now extended to
such processes as determinantal and permanental processes having fast
decreasing kernels or  the zero set of Gaussian entire functions.
We shall also study the limit
behaviour of some new geometric statistics of point processes  useful in
signal processing and  statistical learning.

Asymptotic resolution of a question of Plesník 
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<b> Abstract: </b>
</td><td>
Fix $d \ge 3$. We show the existence of a constant $c>0$ such that any graph of diameter at most $d$ has average distance at most $d-c \frac{d^{3/2}}{\sqrt n}$, where $n$ is the number of vertices. Moreover, we exhibit graphs certifying sharpness of this bound up to the choice of $c$. This constitutes an asymptotic  solution to a longstanding open problem of Plesník. Furthermore we solve that open problem of Plesník exactly for digraphs in case the order is large compared with the diameter.

 Fluid limit for the coarsening phase of the condensing zero-range process.
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<b> Abstract: </b> 
</td><td>
 In this work we prove that the first phase of coarsening in the condensing zero range process on a finite number of sites with N particles, as N tends to infinity, is described by a fluid limit, when time is appropiately rescaled. According to this limit, in a finite time determined by the initial distribution of particles, the process reaches an state in which mass concentrates at the sites having maximal weight under the invariant measure of the underlying random walk. Work in progress joint with Ines Armendariz and Milton Jara.

Critical percolation on scale-free random graphs
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<b> Abstract: </b>
</td><td>
Empirical findings have shown that many real-world networks are scale-free
in the
sense that there is a high variability in the number of connections of the
elements of
the networks. Spurred by these empirical findings, models have been
proposed
for such networks. In this talk, we describe a particular class of random
graphs
in which edges are present independently but with unequal edge occupation
probabilities, that are moderated by appropriate vertex weights. For such
models,
it is known precisely when there is a giant component, meaning that a
positive
proportion of the vertices is connected to one another. Empirical studies
show that many
real-world networks have degree sequences with diverging second moment,
where the
vertices with largest degrees or `hubs' play a profound role in the
network's functionality.
<br> <br>
Percolation on networks is one of the simplest models for network
functionality.
It can be interpreted as describing the effect of random attacks on the
network,
where edges are removed independently with a fixed probability.
Interestingly,
networks with diverging second moment degree tend to be robust to such
random attacks,
in the sense that a giant component remains after percolation for any
fixed positive
retention probability.
<br> <br>
We investigate the critical behavior for two popular models of complex
networks
with diverging second moments, the configuration model and the generalized
random graph.
We identify what the critical values are, and how they scale with the
graph size.
Interestingly, this scaling turns out to be rather different for the
configuration model,
where hubs share many edges between them, and the generalized random
graph, for which
hubs are connected by at most one edge. Thus, the single-edge constraint
plays a significant role.
This clears up part of the confusion in the physics literature.

Slightly Subcritical Hypercube Percolation
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<b> Abstract: </b>
</td><td>
I will discuss some recent results about bond percolation on
the sequence hypercube graphs Q_m (and other graphs / graph sequences)
in the slightly subcritical regime where the percolation parameter p
tends to the critical value from below, but sufficiently slowly to
remain on the subcritical side of the critical window. I will show
some bounds on the sizes and diameters of the largest clusters, and on
the mixing time of random walk on such clusters.
These results hold in different levels of generality, and in
particular, some of the estimates hold for classes of graphs such as
high-dimensional tori, expanders of high degree and girth, products of
complete graphs, and infinite lattices in high dimensions.

The chromatic number of random Borsuk graphs
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<b>Abstract:</b> 
</td><td>
We study a model of random graph where vertices are n i.i.d.
uniform random points on the unit sphere S^d, and a pair of vertices
is connected if the Euclidean distance between them is at least 2−ϵ.
We are interested in the chromatic number of this graph as n tends to
infinity.
<br><br>
It is not too hard to see that if ϵ>0 is small and fixed, then the
chromatic number is d+2 with high probability. We show that this holds
even if ϵ tends to 0 slowly enough. We quantify the rate at which ϵ
can tend to zero and still have the same chromatic number, up to a
constant factor. The proof depends on combining topological methods
(namely the Lyusternik--Schnirelman--Borsuk theorem) with geometric
probability arguments. The rate we obtain is best possible, up to a
constant factor --- if ϵ tends to 0 faster than this, we show that the
graph is (d+1)-colorable with high probability. This is joint work
with Francisco Martinez-Figueroa.

Site percolation on planar triangulations

<b> Abstract: </b>

 Angel, Benjamini and Horesh conjectured that for every planar triangulation of minimal degree at least 6, the critical probability for site percolation is at most 1/2. In this talk, we introduce a new technique to prove the weaker bound $p_c \leq 2/3$, which applies to planar graphs that are not necessarily triangulations. This is joint work with John Haslegrave.

Information dissemination in graphs using many random walks
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<b> Abstract: </b> 
</td><td>
We study the problem of randomized information dissemination in 
networks. We compare the now standard push-pull protocol, with an 
agent-based alternative visit-exchange, where information is 
disseminated by a collection of agents performing independent random 
walks. In the visit-exchange protocol, both nodes and agents store 
information, and each time an agent visits a node, the two exchange all 
information they have.
<br><br>
We consider the broadcast times of a single piece of information in an 
$n$-node graph, assuming a linear number of agents, that start from the 
stationary distribution. We observe that there are graphs on which the 
agent-based protocols as significantly faster than push-pull, and graphs 
where the converse is true. We attribute the good performance of 
visit-exchange to their inherently fair bandwidth utilization, and 
conclude that, in certain settings, agent-based information 
dissemination, separately or in combination with push-pull, can 
significantly improve the broadcast time.
<br><br>
The graphs considered above are highly non-regular. Our main technical 
result is that on any regular graph, of at least logarithmic degree, 
push-pull and visit-exchange have the same asymptotic broadcast time. 
The proof uses a novel coupling argument which relates the random 
choices of vertices in push-pull with the random walks in 
visit-exchange. This is joint work with George Giakkoupis and Frederik 
Mallmann-Trenn.

Clustering in a hyperbolic model of complex networks
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<b> Abstract: </b> 
</td><td>
In this talk we consider the clustering coefficient and
clustering function in a random graph model proposed by Krioukov et
al.~in 2010. In this model, nodes are chosen randomly inside a disk in
the hyperbolic plane and two nodes are connected if they are at most a
certain hyperbolic distance from each other. It has been previously
shown that this model has various properties associated with complex
networks, including a power-law degree distribution, "short distances"
and a non-vanishing clustering coefficient. The model is specified using
three parameters: the number of nodes $n$, which we think of as going to
infinity, and $\alpha, \nu > 0$, which we think of as constant. Roughly
speaking, the parameter $\alpha$ controls the power law exponent of the
degree sequence and $\nu$ the average degree.

Here we show that the clustering coefficient tends in probability to a
constant $\gamma$ that we give explicitly as a closed form expression in
terms of $\alpha, \nu$ and certain special functions. This improves over
earlier work by Gugelmann et al., who proved that the clustering
coefficient remains bounded away from zero with high probability, but
left open the issue of convergence to a limiting constant. Similarly, we
are able to show that $c(k)$, the average clustering coefficient over
all vertices of degree exactly $k$, tends in probability to a limit
$\gamma(k)$ given explicitly as a closed form expression in terms of
$\alpha, \nu$ and certain special functions. We are able to extend this
last result also to sequences $(k_n)_n$ where $k_n$ grows as a function
of $n$. Our results show that $\gamma(k)$ scales differently, as $k$
grows, for different ranges of $\alpha$. More precisely, $\gamma(k) =
\Theta( k^{2 - 4\alpha})$ if $\frac{1}{2} < \alpha < \frac{3}{4}$,
$\gamma(k) = \Theta( \log(k) / k )$ if $\alpha=\frac{3}{4}$ and $\gamma
= \Theta(k^{-1})$ when $\alpha > \frac{3}{4}$. These results contradict a
prediction of Krioukov et al., which stated that the limiting values
$\gamma(k)$ should always scale with $k^{-1}$ as we let $k$ grow.

The dispersion time of random walks on finite graphs
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<b> Abstract: </b> 
</td><td>
Consider two random processes on an $n$ vertex graph related to Internal diffusion-limited aggregation (IDLA). In each process $n$ particles perform independent random walks from a fixed origin until they reach an unvisited vertex, at which point they settle. In the first process only one particle moves until settling and then the next starts, in the second process all particles are released together. We study the <i>dispersion time</i> which is the time taken for the longest walk to settle. 
<br><br>
We present a coupling which allows us to compare dispersion time across the two processes and show which is ``faster''. We prove bounds on the dispersion time(s) in terms of more well studied parameters of random walks such as the cover time and mixing time. In addition we discuss how to determine the order of the dispersion time for many well known graphs such as expanders, complete binary trees, tori etc. This is joint work with Nicol&aacute;s Rivera, Alexandre Stauffer and Thomas Sauerwald.

Inhomogeneous percolation on multi-range trees
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<b> Abstract: </b> 
</td><td>
 We consider an inhomogeneous percolation model on an oriented regular tree, where besides the usual bonds, additional bonds of a certain length are also present. Percolation is defined on this graph, by letting these additional edges be open with probability q and every other edge with probability p. We give an improved lower bound for the critical curve which delimits the set of pairs (p, q) for which there is almost surely no infinite cluster. Furthermore, we show that the cluster of the root has the same distribution as the family tree of a certain multi-type branching process, which allows us to state some limit theorems.

Embedding urn models into random recursive trees

<b> Abstract: </b>

Joint works with Antar Bandyopadhyay, Indian Statistical Institute, New Delhi,
 and Svante Janson, Uppsala University.
<br><br>
We introduce a generalization of the classical P\'{o}lya urn scheme with colors indexed by a Polish space, say, $S$. The urns are defined as finite measures on $S$ endowed with the Borel $\sigma$-algebra. In particular, one may consider the set of colors to be $\mathbb{Z}^d$. The generalization is 
an extension of a model introduced earlier by Blackwell and MacQueen (1973). We present a coupling of the observed sequence of colors from such a scheme in terms an associated
<i>branching Markov chain</i> on the <i>random recursive tree</i>. Using this coupling we prove that the asymptotic behaviour of the random profile of the urn is completely determined by the ergodic properties of the corresponding branching Markov chain.
