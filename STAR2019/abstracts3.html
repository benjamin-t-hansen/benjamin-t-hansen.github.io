Toward a cosmological theory of complex networks
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<b> Abstract: </b> 
</td><td>
Structural and dynamical similarities of different real networks
suggest that some universal laws might accurately describe the
dynamics of these networks, albeit the nature and common origin of
such laws remain elusive. Here we show that causal network
representing the large-scale structure of spacetime in our
accelerating universe is a power-law graph with strong clustering,
similar to many complex networks such as the Internet, social or
biological networks. We prove that this strcutural similarity is a
consequence of the asymptotic equivalence between the large-scale
growth dynamics of complex networks and causal networks. This
equivalence suggests that unexpectedly similar laws govern the
dynamics of complex networks and spacetime in the universe, with
implications to network science and cosmology. However, our simple
frameworks is unable to explain the emergence of community structure,
a property that, along with scale-free degree distributions and strong
clustering, is commonly found in real complex networks. Here we  show
how latent network geometry coupled with preferential attachment of
the nodes to this geometry fills this gap. We call this mechanism
geometric preferential attachment (GPA) and validate it against the
Internet. GPA gives rise to soft communities that provide a different
perspective on the community structure in networks. The connections
between GPA and cosmological models, including inflation, are also
discussed.

The Robot Crawler Model
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<b> Abstract: </b> 
</td><td>
Web crawlers are used by internet search engines to gather information about the web graph. In this talk we investigate a simple process which models this software by walking around the vertices of a graph. Once initial random vertex weights have been assigned, the robot crawler traverses the graph deterministically following a greedy algorithm, always visiting the neighbour of least weight and then updating this weight to be the highest overall. We consider the maximum, minimum and average number of steps taken by the crawler to visit every vertex of firstly, complete k-partite graphs and secondly, sparse Erdos-Renyi random graphs. Our work follows on from a paper of Bonato et. al. who introduced the model.

Metastability of the Ising model on random regular graphs at zero temperature 
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<b> Abstract: </b>
</td><td>
We study the metastability of the ferromagnetic Ising model on a random $r$-regular graph in the zero temperature limit. We prove that in the presence of a small positive external field the time that it takes to go from the all minus state to the all plus state behaves like $\exp(\beta n (r/2+O(\sqrt{r})))$ when the inverse temperature $\beta\rightarrow\infty$ and the number of vertices $n$ is large enough but fixed. For the proof it is necessary to understand the global structure of the random graph, especially bounds on the isoperimetric number of random regular graphs are used. These bounds are combined with the so-called pathwise approach to metastability.

Generating maximally disassortative graphs with a given degree distribution
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<b> Abstract: </b> 
</td><td>
The correlation between the degrees of a randomly sampled edge, called
degree-degree correlations, has become part of the standard set of topological
features of networks. Many research has been done on finding consistent measures
and null-models for these correlations as well as analyzing their impact on
other properties of, and processes on networks. However, there are still many
open questions related to these correlations, such as the existence and structure
of graphs with extreme (positive)negative correlations.
We consider the optimization problem of generating graphs with a given degree
sequence, that minimize degree-degree correlations, as measured by Spearman’s
rho. We describe a deterministic algorithm, based on a minimizing partition
approach, that solves this problem. We then extend this algorithm to a
probabilistic setting and show that this enables us to generate simple graphs
with a given degree distribution, for which degree-degree correlations are minimized.
By using the view point of the minimizing partition, we are able to obtain
a complete characterization of the joint-degree distribution of these maximally
dissassortative graphs, in terms of the size-biased degree distribution. This
allows us to compute the minimal value of Spearman’s rho for graphs with a
given degree distribution. With these results we can show that when the degree
distribution is scale-free, the value of the exponent of the distribution, by itself,
gives no guarantees for the minimal value of Spearman’s rho. In particular,
given any exponent, we can construct a scale-free degree distribution such that
this minimal value will be arbitrary close to zero.
More interestingly, we show that for maximally disassortative graphs with
either a Poisson or Pareto degree distribution, the minimal value of Spearman’s
rho depends on, respectively, the mean and exponent, and we can tune this
value between −1 and 0, by either increasing or decreasing these. For example,
for a Pareto degree distribution with exponent $\gamma = 2.5$, Spearman rho cannot be
smaller than −0.5. This is a crucial observation, since it shows that, depending
on the specific degree distribution, a graph with negative measured value for
degree-degree correlations close to zero, can still have a maximally disassortative
structure.

Homological connectivity of random hypergraphs
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<b> Abstract: </b> 
</td><td>
We consider 2-dimensional simplicial complexes that are generated from
the binomial random 3-uniform hypergraph by taking the
downward-closure. We determine when this simplicial complex is
homologically connected, meaning that its zero-th and first homology
groups with coefficients in $\mathbb{F}_2$ vanish. Although this is
not intrinsically a monotone property, we show that it nevertheless
has a single sharp threshold, and indeed prove a hitting time result
relating the connectedness to the disappearance of the last minimal
obstruction.

Agreement dynamics on random graphs
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<b>Abstract:</b> 
</td><td>
Sufficiently dense random graphs are expected to support long-range ordering. In particular, emergence of ferromagnetism in Ising model on random graph is known to appear exactly at the percolation transition. We show that this is not the case for directed random graphs, where ferromagnetism appears but for substantially denser random graphs. Also the dynamics of Ising models on undirected and directed random graphs much differ. While the undirected random quench gets trapped in the disordered configuration, the directed graph version evolves toward the configuration with spontaneously broken symmetry. We argue that directed version of Ising model generates some kind of interfacial noise and that might explain why it differs from the undirected version.  We also discuss the behaviour of other agreement dynamics systems (Naming Game, Voter model) on random graphs.

Optimal induced universal graphs for bounded-degree graphs
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<b> Abstract: </b>
</td><td>
We show that for any constant $\Delta \ge 2$, there exists a graph $\Gamma$ with $O(n^{\Delta / 2})$ vertices which contains every $n$-vertex graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ as an induced subgraph. For odd $\Delta$ this significantly improves the best-known earlier bound of Esperet et al. and is optimal up to a constant factor, as it is known that any such graph must have at least  $\Omega(n^{\Delta/2})$ vertices.

Our proof builds on the approach of Alon and Capalbo (SODA 2008) together with several additional ingredients. The construction of $\Gamma$ is explicit and is based on an appropriately defined composition of high-girth expander graphs. The proof also provides an efficient deterministic procedure for finding, for any given input graph $H$ on $n$ vertices with maximum degree at most $\Delta$, an induced subgraph of $\Gamma$ isomorphic to $H$.

On the continuous-time limit of the Barab&aacute;si-Albert random graph
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<b>Abstract: </b>
</td><td>
We prove a weak convergence of the Barab&aacute;si-Albert random graph to a modified Yule model, where the Yule process that represents the appearance of in-links must be conditioned to start with a fix number of individuals. Through this relation we explain why asymptotic properties of a random vertex in the Barab&aacute;si-Albert model, coincide with the asymptotic properties of a random genus in the Yule model. As a by-product of our analysis, we obtain the explicit expression of the limit degree distribution for the Barab&aacute;si-Albert model. This result is given in (2) using combinatoric techniques.

Laplacian eigenvalues of a graph and Brouwer's conjecture
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<b> Abstract: </b> 
</td><td>
Let $G(V,E)$ be a simple graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges having vertex set $V(G)=\{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\}$ and edge set $E(G)=\{e_1, e_2,\dots, e_m\}$. The adjacency matrix $A=(a_{ij})$ of $G$ is a $(0, 1)$-square matrix of order $n$ whose $(i,j)$-entry is equal to 1 if $v_i$ is adjacent to $v_j$ and equal to 0, otherwise. The spectrum of the adjacency matrix is called the $A$-spectrum of $G$. If $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \cdots, \lambda_n$ is the adjacency spectrum of $G$, the energy of $G$ is defined as $E(G)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}|\lambda_i|$. Let $D(G)={diag}(d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n)$ be the diagonal matrix associated to $G$, where $d_i=\deg(v_i),$ for all $i=1,2,\dots,n$. The matrix $L(G)=D(G)-A(G)$  is called the Laplacian matrix and its spectrum is called the Laplacian spectrum ($L$-spectrum) of the graph $G$. 
Let $ 0=\mu_n\leq\mu_{n-1}\leq\cdots\leq\mu_1 $ be 
 the $ L $ -spectrum of $G$ and let $S_k(G)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{k}\mu_i$, $k=1,2,\dots,n$ be the sum of $k$ largest Laplacian eigenvalues of $G$. Andries Brouwer (1) conjectured that for a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, $S_k(G)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{k}\mu_i\leq m+{k+1 \choose 2}$, for any $k$, $k=1,2,\dots,n$.
 <br><br>
The Laplacian energy of a graph $G$ as put forward by Gutman and Zhou is defined as $ LE(G)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}|\mu_i-\frac{2m}{n}| $. It was conjectured by Gutman that for any graph $G$ the inequality $LE(G)\geq E(G)$ holds. This conjecture was disproved by Stevanovic by furnishing an example of a family of graphs for which $LE(G)< E(G)$. Du et. al (2,3) obtained bounds for the energy and Laplacian energy of a random graph and used this approach to show that $LE(G)\geq E(G)$ is true for almost all graphs.
 <br><br>
In this talk, we discuss the progress on Brouwer's conjecture (1,4,5,6,7,8) and also the random graph approach to show that $LE(G)\geq E(G)$ holds for almost all graphs.

The diameter of hyperbolic random graphs
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<b> Abstract: </b>
</td><td>

We study a model of random geometric graphs in the hyperbolic plane, that was introduced recently by Krioukov et al. These graphs are constructed by sampling a
fixed number of points randomly from a disk in the hyperbolic plane
and then connecting pairs of points by an edge if their hyperbolic
distance is less than a certain threshold value. This random graph
model recapitulates various properties of complex networks, including
a scale-free degree distribution, clustering and short distances.
In this talk we will consider the graph diameter of the largest component.
We give a logarithmic upper for this quantity (the upper bound holds
a.a.s., that is with probability tending to one as the number of nodes
tends to infinity). This improves over (a.a.s.) polylogarithmic upper
bounds in earlier works by Kiwi-Mitsche and Friedrich-Krohmer, and
matches an a.a.s. lower bound by Friedrich-Krohmer.

Clustering in random graphs with natural cutoffs and single-edge constraints
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<b> Abstract: </b>
</td><td>

We investigate the presence of triangles in two random graph models with single-edge constraints: the erased configuration model, and a model where hidden variables determine the connection probabilities between different vertices. Specifically, we study networks with a power-law degree distribution with $2<\tau< 3 $, so that the degrees have infinite variance. We show that only triangles between vertices of degree $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ contribute to the clustering coefficient. We also study the local clustering coefficient of nodes with degree $k$, $c(k)$. The single edge constraints of the erased configuration model and the hidden variable model cause $c(k)$ to be constant for small values of $k$ and to decay for $k>\sqrt{N}$. Again, the only contribution to $c(k)$ comes from triangles between vertices with degrees in very specific regimes, depending on $k$.

In this talk, we will provide a new proof of exponential

Spatial Gibbs random graphs

<b> Abstract: </b> 
</td><td>
Many real-world networks of interest are embedded in physical space.
We present a new random graph model aiming to reflect the interplay
between the geometries of the graph and of the underlying space. The
model favors configurations with small average graph distance between
vertices, but adding an edge comes at a cost measured according to the
geometry of the ambient physical space. In most cases, we identify the
order of magnitude of the average graph distance as a function of the
parameters of the model. As the proofs reveal, hierarchical structures
naturally emerge from our simple modeling assumptions. Moreover, a
critical regime exhibits an infinite number of phase transitions.

The probability of nonexistence of a subgraph in a moderately sparse
random graph
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<b> Abstract: </b> 
</td><td>
We develop  a general procedure that finds recursions for
statistics counting isomorphic copies of a graph $G_0$  in the common
random graph models $G(n,m)$ and $G(n,p)$. Our results apply
 when the average degrees  of the random graphs  are
below  the  threshold at which each edge is included in a copy of
 $G_0$.   For all strictly balanced subgraphs $G_0$, our results give
much information on the
  distribution of the number of copies of $G_0$ that are not in large
''clusters'' of copies. The probability that a random graph in
$G(n,p)$ has no copies of $G_0$ is shown to be given asymptotically by
the exponential of a power
series in $n$ and $p$, over a fairly wide range of
$p$. A corresponding result is also given for $G(n,m)$, which gives an
asymptotic formula for the number of graphs with $n$ vertices, $m$
edges and no copies of $G_0$, for the applicable range of $m$.
