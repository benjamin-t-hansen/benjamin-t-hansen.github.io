          <p>Ukraine’s economy is in transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy.  This transition has been one of the longest of former Soviet states and has had mixed success.  Many of the hopes of progress markets would bring were snuffed out by crony capitalism.  The power struggle of the 1990’s and failed government policies are largely responsible for the limping economic progress of Ukraine.  Monopoly power of oligarchs and corruption has prevented efficiency.  However, there are reasons to be hopeful about the future of Ukraine.  The dissonance between the people and the policymakers was sufficient to cause one revolution and globalization should break the power of economic elite.  </p>

        <!-- From Planned to Oligarchs
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="planned">

          </div>
          <p class="lead">From Planned to Oligarchs</p>
          <p>Under the soviet system, the large agricultural regions were collectivized.  “Its fertile black soil generated more than one-fourth of Soviet agricultural output, and its farms provided substantial quantities of meat, milk, grain, and vegetables to other republics” (World Factbook).  There was also development of the heavy industry.  Then in 1991, the Soviet Union was dissolved and Ukraine began its journey to a market economy.</p>
          <p>As expected, in the transition from a planned economy to a market economy there would be an initial decline as industries restructure followed by an upswing in production.  The initial decline lasted approximately ten years. “During the decade from 1989 to 1999, the country’s output declined by 54 percent” (Åslund 328).  This is a massive loss which undoubtedly affected the wellbeing of the population.</p>
          <p>Out of the chaos of the initial years of reformation, a few entrepreneurs found ways to consolidate power creating the Ukrainian Oligarchs.  Rent seeking behavior stifled development and competition was blocked by legal means and by preventing access to financing.  This privatization made billionaires overnight and is an example of Insider Privatization, as discussed in class.  However, as the millennium approached, so did an external default for the government.  “Frightened by the way Russian oligarchs had suffered in the aftermath of the financial crash of August 1998, the local oligarchs came to the conclusion that Ukraine’s creditworthiness had to be restored” (Åslund 328).  The oligarchs helped bring Yushchenko into power as the prime minister, and he set in motion sweeping reforms, some of which curtailed the power of the oligarchs.  “By raising state revenues, Yushchenko turned a budget deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP in 1999 to a surplus of 0.6 percent in 2000, and reduced the foreign state debt from $9.3 to $8.0 billion. To an impressive degree, the playing field had been leveled and, as a consequence, the Ukrainian economy turned around” (Åslund 328).  This demonstrates the pragmatic self-interest of the oligarchs.  In order to maintain the value of their wealth, their power had to be reduced.</p>

        <!-- J-Curve and Orange Revolution
        ================================================== -->

          <div class="page-header">
          </div>
          <p class="lead">J-Curve and Orange Revolution</p>
          <p>The early 2000’s marked the beginning of the upswing of the j-curve.   This growth was largely in the middle class.  “In 2004, disposable household incomes escalated by 16.8 percent” (Åslund 329).  The sudden empowerment of the middle class became a force following voter fraud in the 2004 Elections.  This resulted in the Orange Revolution, “the end result of the accumulating dissatisfaction with the lack of democracy, limited freedom, and fragile rule of law, and it was a challenge to pervasive corruption and oligarchic rule” (Åslund 337).  The economic dissonance finally caused an upheaval of the system. </p>

         <p>“But five years later, the World Bank noted that after the Orange Revolution ‘laws and institutions did not change materially.’ The Bank listed Ukraine’s fiscal crisis, investment climate, financial system, and public sector governance as the priority sectors for reform” (Sutela).  Furthermore, the global recession of 2009 would have caused Ukraine to default on its debt if IMF had not intervened. “In 2009, as GDP declined and the hryvnia weakened, external debt stock was 91.5 percent of GDP and 191.6 percent of annual exports—clearly an unsustainable level for Ukraine” (Sutela).

        <!-- GDP and Unemployment
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="GDP">
          <div class="page-header">
          </div>
          <p class="lead">GDP and Unemployment</p>
          <p>Ukraine’s economy has largely kept pace with the other former Soviet states; however, it was expected to outperform many of the other countries in the region.  When looking at the data it is important to remember the statistics do not bring light to the whole picture, as the shadow economy makes up approximately 50% of GDP.</p>

         <p>The GDP and the GDP per Capita demonstrates how the economy has transformed over the past twenty years.  At the fall of the USSR GDP, per Capita, was $1,307 (Sutela).  Over the next four years the GDP was cut in half and likewise with the GDP per Capita.  This was the bottom of the J-curve.  It wasn’t until 2000 that GDP started to increase.  “The Ukrainian economy took off, with growth of 5.9 percent in 2000, and even accelerated later….For the last five years, from 2000 to 2004, Ukraine’s GDP has risen by a stunning annual average of 9 percent, and in 2004 it surged by no less than 12.1 percent” (Åslund 328).  GDP per capita grew spectacularly until 2009 and the financial crisis.  While GDP contracted by over 15%, it has since rebounded and GDP per Capita is now $3860, with purchase power parity of $7650 (World in 2012).  This is approximately three times the official figure from 1991.  This is a huge financial empowerment for the people.  They are able to buy goods previously outside their budget constraints.  Gross fixed capital formation has been holding in the range of 18-19% following the financial crisis of 2009 according to ISF.  As an economy in transition, higher 20s would be more favorable, but upper teens is acceptable.
          </p>
          <p>Of course, this growth in GDP per Capita could have gone all to the oligarchs at the top, only empowering the rich further.  However, “social indicators imply massive improvements from 2001 to 2004. Average wages and disposable household income rose much faster than GDP” (Åslund 329). Also if we look at the 2008 Gini Coefficient, it was 27.5 (World Factbook).  This puts them ahead of the EU and slightly behind Germany in terms of income equality.  Certainly the rise in GDP has caused greater inequality than initially, however the increases in GDP have outweighed some increases in inequality.  </p>
          <p>Unemployment numbers appeared to fair well given the drop in GDP in 2009.  In 2007 and 2009, unemployment was 6.4% and in 8.8%, respectively (IFS).  While an increase in unemployment of 2.4% is painful for an economy, unemployment in an advanced economy would have skyrocketed when faced with GDP contraction of 15%.  There are many factors which may have contributed to this: The shadow economy and decreasing labor force are two reasons.  If people are fired, they may find it easier to leave the labor force and work illegally.  Also when the labor market is shrinking, the value of labor increases.  Thus it makes it easier to find a job.  According to the ISF unemployment dropped to 7.9% in 2011 (IFS).</p>

                 <!-- Recent Crisis
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="crisis">
          <div class="page-header">
          </div>
          <p class="lead">Recent Crisis and Sectors</p>
          <p>The major reason Ukraine didn’t implode following the financial crisis is due to the loans from IMF.  However, “Ukraine lost access to IMF money in 2009 because of a lack of political will to act on its promises for fiscal restraint” (Real World).  Yet Ukraine was able receive an additional $14.9 billion over 2.5 years in 2010.  This back and forth release of funds is an attempt by IMF to integrate Ukraine into the European economies and implementation of policies based in markets.  “The agreement reached includes revised targets to bring the deficit down to 5.5% of the GDP in 2010 and 3.5% in 2011…The deal also focuses on improving the health of the country's banking sector” (Real World).  The history of what is agreed upon and what Ukraine delivers is a sign of anything, this new round of funding will be ended soon. </p>

          <p>The breakdown of the economy by sector is what we would expect from a transition economy.  The following is from The World Factbook: 15.8% of the labor force is in agriculture and contributes 10.5% of the GDP.  Industry is 18.5% of the labor force and contributes 33.5% of the GDP and 65.7% of the labor force is in the service sector, contributing 56% of GDP (The World Factbook).  The labor force will move out of agriculture as productivity increases.  Because of the vast agricultural potential of the region, it is likely to remain an important component of GDP for the next few decades.</p>

                 <!-- Agriculture and Energy
        ================================================== -->

          </div>
          <p class="lead">Agriculture and Energy</p>
          <p>After the fall of the USSR, agriculture in Ukraine suffered.  Farm subsidies were removed and investments in capital fell significantly.  “Fertilizer use fell by 85 percent over a ten-year period, and grain production by 50 percent” (“Agricultural Overview”).  Old machinery, lack of storage, and the inability to secure credit at favorable rates are preventing the full development of this sector (“Agricultural Overview”).  Furthermore, foreign investors are prohibited from buying agricultural land, “specifically bars all foreign citizens and foreign-owned companies from owning such land” (Frishberg).  This is mainly to protect the agricultural oligarchs from losing control of the industry.  There is huge potential in agriculture, but until investment is allowed, both foreign and domestic, it will remain underdeveloped.</p>

          <p>Energy issues in Ukraine are far reaching.  A large portion oil from Russia to the EU flows through Ukraine.  Thus disputes between Russia and Ukraine over oil pricing could have huge impacts on the economies of Europe.  Thus in 2009, “Ukraine’s main external energy policy goals are to hold down gas import prices, to promote the continued (and if possible expanded) use of its infrastructure for transit of Russian gas to Europe, to encourage the cancellation of the South Stream project” (Baev 39).  As long as Russia keeps import prices much lower than market value, Ukraine’s industries and households will remain completely inefficient in their use of gas.  Ukraine has had a near monopoly on transportation of oil from Russia to the rest of Europe, which has allowed cheap oil to flow into until 2009.  Recently, Russia has been rethinking their subsidization of oil and is in the process of building pipelines through the Black Sea and to the North.  Ultimately, Ukraine cannot rely on the profits from cheap energy.  As the Carnegie Endowment describes, it is essentially the same as the resource curse. “The windfall Ukraine enjoyed meant that industry did not have to diversify or become more sophisticated—two characteristics that are necessary for competition in today’s markets” (Sutela).  As Schumpeter discussed, ending the subsidization will in the long run be good for the economy.  It will force industries to modernize and become more efficient. </p>

                 <!-- Environment, Transportation, and Investment

          <p class="lead">Environment, Transportation, and Investment</p>
          <p>On the environmental side of things, Ukraine will continue to deal with the Chernobyl disaster.  “In Ukraine, 5–7 percent of government spending each year is still devoted to Chernobyl-related benefits and programmes [sic]” (33 Chernobyl ) while the region lost much of its agricultural production due to radiation. “Although resettlement reduced the population’s radiation doses, it was for many a deeply traumatic experience” (35 Chernobyl).  These resettlements changed the economic structure of the region and the psychology of those involved.  </p>

          <p>While significant amounts of road and rails were built under the Soviet Union, major upgrades are necessary due to the poor condition of transportation.  One recent boon for the infrastructure was the co-hosting of Euro 2012, “through a $5bn government spending spree on infrastructure ahead of the tournament, thousands of kilometres of Ukrainian roads were repaved” (Cienski).  In addition, five new airports were built.  These investments are helping bring in foreign investment. </p> 
          <p>While Ukraine states they want to encourage investment, the lack of a fair rule of law greatly inhibits foreign investment, “The country's complex laws and regulations, poor corporate governance, weak enforcement of contract law by courts, and particularly corruption have discouraged broad foreign direct investment in Ukraine” (Background).   Once again, the political system is preventing the economy from reaching its potential.  That being said “FDI Net inward foreign direct investment (FDI) has been positive since 1992, varying in 2005–2010 between $5 and $10 billion annually. But most foreign direct investment has gone to closed-sector services such as retail trade and finance, while the industries inherited from the Soviet Union were privatized to domestic owners and are controlled by oligarchs” (Sutela).  The oligarchs are able to stay in power because investment is not allowed, even though investment would be incredibly beneficial to the Ukrainian economy. </p>

          <p class="lead">Government Spending and Trade</p>
          <p>While the growth in GDP over the 2000s showed signs of optimism, the government acted as if the growth rate would stay at its high level permanently.   The policymakers built a lavish pension system.  The departing government left behind a poison pill, when on September 1, 2004, Prime Minister Yanukovych doubled pensions, causing pension costs to rise from the internationally high level of 9 percent of GDP in 2004 to a staggering 16 percent in 2005—that is, the highest in the world” ( Åslund 345).  This is an enormous transfer compared to the wages earned in a month.  In 2005, Anders Åslund wrote: “Furthermore, the government raised public wages by a staggering 57 percent… Altogether, the International Monetary Fund assesses that Ukraine’s total public expenditures will increase by approximately 5 percent of GDP and reach about 44 percent of GDP, which approximates the level of a West European country” (Åslund 345).  While these benefits are in the short run are politically attractive, the economy can’t sustain these transfer payments in a fully developed society, let alone a developing society.  To offset this “ all other public expenditures, including health care, education and public investment, have been reduced” (Åslund 345).  In order have these current benefits, the possible economic future had to compromised. </p>

          <p>Trade dependence is a vital part of Ukraine’s economy; however it has recently been an issue due to the global economic recession.  From the DOTS, we see exports hovering around 50% of GDP.  Thus any world crisis or even regional crisis will have an enormous impact on the economy of Ukraine.  This is in part why the 2009 crisis caused GDP to shrink by 15% and why a potential Euro crisis this winter is worrisome for Ukraine.  However Ukraine has been aiming to diversify their trade.   “While countries of the former Soviet Union remain important trading partners, especially Russia for energy imports, Ukraine's trade is becoming more diversified. The European Union (EU) accounts for about 30% of Ukraine's trade, while CIS countries account for about 40%” (Background). Nevertheless, if Ukraine wants to stabilize its GDP, it must produce goods desirable for the domestic market, making national consumption a more important factor than exports.  This will also help reduce the balance of trade deficit, which according to the IFS was -13 billion dollars in 2011.</p>

                 <!-- Corruption and the Shadow Economy
        ================================================== -->

          <p class="lead">Corruption and the Shadow Economy</p>
          <p>The government is incredibly corrupt, a tendency inherited from the USSR.  While there are a few countries more corrupt “In the 2010 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index, Ukraine is number 134 out of 178” (Sutela).  The power of the oligarchs is far reaching.  A few wealthy businessmen dominate the economy and own most of the media.  They are often control decision-making and political discourse.  While they are divided over who support coming into office, they largely act to maintain their own interest “We see that the government is split with each political grouping controlling separate branches of government for personal gain. Monopolies are thriving in the fight and the infighting is not allowing Ukraine's economy to develop" (Oleachyk).  Thus these businessmen engage in rent seeking behavior rather than making quality products efficiently.  Consumers in Ukraine overpay for products as a result.  </p>

          <p>Corruption fosters the existence of the shadow economy. “The global average share of the shadow economy came down from 34.0 percent of official GDP in 1999 to 31.0 percent in 2007.  In Ukraine, the share declined from 52.7 to 46.8 percent” (Sutela).  While the informal economy’s share of GDP is enormous, it should be expected simply due to how corrupt the government is.  The good news is GDP per capita is actually significantly higher than the official data if we include the shadow economy, thus the wellbeing of Ukrainians is higher than stated.  However, an informal economy is ultimately not the most efficient system of exchanging goods.  Many of the government’s actions have only exasperated the cycle “[corruption] hindered the building of functional administrative institutions like tax authorities, and escaping into the untaxed shadow economy was easy… As the tax base grew narrower, attempts to increase tax revenue often meant that what could be taxed was taxed too heavily. This again forced many citizens and companies into the shadow economy. In the process, any respect for law tended to evaporate” (Sutela).  If there is a motif of this paper, it is that rule of law is so weak, any law is meaningless unless implemented.</p> 
          
          <p>The taxation, as discussed above, plays a huge factor in creating the shadow economy.  In 2008 “High taxes are considered to be the main reasons for the size of the shadow economy…total contributions reach 54.2 to 68.2% of wages” (Libanova).  It is no wonder the shadow economy is massive.  Having the economic cost of a welfare state without the benefits alienates the workforce.</p>

                 <!-- Strengths
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="strengths">
          <div class="page-header">
          </div>
          <p class="lead">Economic Strengths</p>
          <p>While the majority of this paper has discussed the problems facing Ukraine, there are some strengths.  Foremost, Ukraine has a highly educated workforce.  This allows them to be much more productive then other countries in the same stage of development.  It also allowed productivity to increase by 94% between 1998-2007 (Libanova). Ultimately, having highly educated members of society will produce the question of “Are we satisfied with our economic system?” for many of the citizens of Ukraine.  It has been asked once this decade and I think it is likely it will be asked again.   </p>

          <p>While the Soviet Union butchered the people, they did provide the base for some high value manufacturing and chemical production: “Ukraine has a broad industrial base, including much of the former U.S.S.R.'s space and rocket industry. The country has a major ferrous metal industry, producing cast iron, steel, and steel pipe, and its chemical industry produces coke, mineral fertilizers, and sulfuric acid.  Manufactured goods include airplanes, turbines, metallurgical equipment, diesel locomotives, and tractors” (Background).  While these industries are largely controlled by oligarchs, they are a mammoth source of income for the country.</p> 
          
          <p>In addition to the strength of the industrial base, Ukraine is rich in raw resources:  Agriculture producing grain, sugar beets, sunflower seeds, vegetables; beef, milk and metallurgy providing coal, ferrous and nonferrous metals according to the World Factbook.  Having both the resources and the industry backed by a highly educated population is begging for huge economic growth.  </p> 

          <p>The final strength addressed here is Ukraine’s outstanding geographical location, namely “its proximity to EU markets is one of Ukraine’s competitive advantages” (Sutela) and boarder on the Black Sea.  As seen earlier, Ukraine has two large markets on both sides, the EU and Russia.  These represent huge opportunities for Ukraine for exports and technology.  </p>

                 <!-- Economic Dissonance
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="dissonance">
          <div class="page-header">
          </div>
          <p class="lead">Economic Dissonance</p>
          <p>This report will concluded by discussing the economic dissonance in Ukraine and the potential future of the country.  As discussed in class, dissonance between an economic system and political structure forces one or both to change.  In recent history, this has happened twice in Ukraine: first in August of 1991, the fall of the Soviet Union and the Orange Revolution in 2004.  Ultimately, people stand up to oppression.  Unfortunately for Ukraine, these revolutions did not launch them into the paradise of capitalism.  Laws were written about providing more equality and opportunity, yet the implementation of them has been dismal.  The result was much the same as the Occupy Wall Street Movement, disillusionment over riots that did not produce tangible change. “it is exactly this sense of defeatism and alienation that may let the Party of Regions, along with its parliamentary allies, extend its hold over the Rada (parliament)” (Dictator).  Also as discussed in class, Hirschman’s Exit, Voice, and Loyalty is occurring.  The voice of the people has been removed, their loyalty is gone, and they are leaving the country.  The population has decreased over the past seven years by over 3% (ISF).</p>

          <p>In the long run, the rule oligarch will diminish.  The oligarchs cannot compete with the world market because they are inefficient in production and thus production costs are higher.  It is only a matter of time before the government allows foreign investment into the key sectors of the economy.  In the meantime, there are millions of people who have struggled against oppression for over half of the past century in Ukraine.  This country represents how government can keep a society from reaching its potential.  What Ukraine needs to do is weed out corruption in the government, while reforming revenue and expenditures, and establish a solid rule of law.  Then allow investment to come in.  Not all at once, but gradually to limit shocks.  This will keep brain drain from occurring and create efficiency.  While this task seems too difficult, it is possible through reform and commitment.  The Ukrainian people have done it in the past.  They are more than capable of doing it again.</p>
